# Exercise 1 : What Are You Learning ?
# Instructions
# Write a function called display_message() that prints one sentence telling everyone what you are learning in this course.
# Call the function, and make sure the message displays correctly.

# def display_message():
#     print("Html, Python Blalallala")

# display_message()

# üåü Exercise 2: What‚Äôs Your Favorite Book ?
# Instructions
# Write a function called favorite_book() that accepts one parameter called title.
# The function should print a message, such as "One of my favorite books is <title>".

#     print(f"One of my favorite books is {title}")

# favorite_book("Sveta")    

#  Exercise 3 : Some Geography
# Instructions
# Write a function called describe_city() that accepts the name of a city and its country as parameters.

# For example ‚ÄúReykjavik is in Iceland‚Äù
# Give the country parameter a default value.

# def describe_city(city,country="Mexico"):
#     print(f"such as {city} is in {country}")

# describe_city("Moscow")    

# Exercise 4 : Random
# Instructions
# Create a function that accepts a number between 1 and 100 and generates another number randomly between 1 and 100.
# Compare the two numbers, if it‚Äôs the same number, display a success message, otherwise show a fail message and display both numbers.

# def random_number(number):
#     a = random.randint(1,101)
#     if number == a:
#         print(f"You win {number}")
#     else:

# random_number(58)        

# üåü Exercise 5 : Let‚Äôs Create Some Personalized Shirts !
# Instructions
# Write a function called make_shirt() that accepts a size and the text of a message that should be printed on the shirt.

# Call the function make_shirt().

# Modify the make_shirt() function so that shirts are large by default with a message that reads ‚ÄúI love Python‚Äù by default.
# Make a large shirt with the default message
# Make medium shirt with the default message
# Make a shirt of any size with a different message.

# Bonus: Call the function make_shirt() using keyword arguments.

# def make_shirt(size="XL", shirt=None):
#     if size == "XL":
#         return print("I love Python")
        
#     if size == "M" or size == "L" :
#         return print(f"The size of the shirt is {size} and the text is {shirt}")    
#     print(f"The  castom size  {size} and the castom {shirt}")
# make_shirt()
# make_shirt("M", 48) 
# make_shirt("XS", 38)
    
# üåü Exercise 6 : Magicians ‚Ä¶
# Instructions
# Using this list of magician‚Äôs names

# magician_names = ['Harry Houdini', 'David Blaine', 'Criss Angel']

# Write a function called make_great() that modifies the list of magicians by adding the phrase "the Great" to each magician‚Äôs name.
# Call the function make_great().
# Call the function show_magicians() to see that the list has actually been modified.    

# magician_names = ['Harry Houdini', 'David Blaine', 'Criss Angel']

# def show_magicians(x):
#     for i in x:
#         print(i)

# def get_random_temp(season="winter"):
#     x = 0
#     if season == "winter" or season == "1" :
#         x = random.uniform(-10.0, 16.0)
#     if season == "summer" or season == "12":
#         x =  random.uniform(16.0, 40.0)   
#     return x
# # print(get_random_temp())
