# Challenge 1
# Ask the user for a number and a length.
# Create a program that prints a list of multiples of the number until the list length reaches length.

# number1 = int(input("write Number\n"))
# lenhht = int(input("write lengt\n"))
# temp = 1
# a = []
# for i in range(lenhht):
    
#     a.append(number1*temp)
#     temp += 1
# print(a)    

# Challenge 2
# Write a program that asks a string to the user, and display a new string 
# with any duplicate consecutive letters removed.

# a = input("write string\n")
# d = ""
# for i in set(a):
#     d += i
# print(f"before {a} after {d}")
