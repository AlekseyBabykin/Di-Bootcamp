1. Installing django 

    >> pip install django

2. Creating a new project (or start a new web application)

    >> django-admin startproject mysite

    >> cd mysite (Where you are going to be 99.9%)

    >> python manage.py runserver

3. Creating a new app 

    >> python manage.py startapp polls 


4. Creting views

    BASIC VIEW TEMPLATE:

        def some_view(request):
            ...


>> python manage.py createsuperuser

5. Creating models

# migration - instruction for the database about changes (adding a table, changing a column etc.)

# 1) python manage.py makemigrations <- create instruction about changes
# 2) python manage.py migrate <- applying the migrations/instructions

django-admin startproject <name>

startapp <name> - creates an app inside the project
runserver
makemigations
migrate

shell ( exit() to quit )

# shell commands

>> from polls.models import Post

new_post = Post(author='Ben', title='First Post', text='Some long text here...')
new_post.save()

Post.objects.get(id=1) <- get one object (where id is 1)

all_posts = Post.objects.all() <- get a queryset with all of the Post objects in the database
all_posts.filter(author='Ben') <- get a queryset with all posts of Ben
all_posts.order_by("author") <- get a queryset with all posts ordered by the author field


Creating virtual environment
1) python -m venv <name>

2) activate virtual environment
    
    for windows users:
    (recommend using CMD)
    >> venv/Scripts/activate
    >> venv/Scripts/activate.bat
    >> venv/Scripts/activate.ps1

    for mac users:
    >> source venv/bin/activate

3) create/update the requirements.txt 

    >> pip freeze requirements.txt

4) Create .gitignore file and ignore the virtual environment folder

5) Deactivate the virtual environment 

    >> deactivate
